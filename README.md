## how to dockerize an application
i've some knowledge in docker (image and container) that was the 1st challenge of DevOps bootcamp. 
Now's the second challenge we were asked to dockerize an application

What does “dockerizing an application” mean?
Dockerizing an application means preparing an application so it can run inside a Docker container in a consistent, portable, and reproducible way.
It involves:
- Defining the application environment
- Packaging the application and its dependencies
- Making it runnable using Docker
- This is done primarily by creating a Dockerfile.
